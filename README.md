# Calculator

## *Project Description*

This application will calculate math operations given the inputs by the user. The user is someone who needs to make 
quick calculations and use math operations for their various needs. This project interests me because I want to 
understand how a calculator operates since I use one every day. It also interests me something as simple as a calculator
isn't as simple as it seems, and this project will be a good way for me to learn Java and exercise the concepts I have
learnt in computer science so far.

## *User Stories*
As a user, I want to be able to...

- add one number to another number
- subtract one number from another number
- multiply two numbers together
- divide two numbers
- calculate an exponent
- find the square root of a number
