# Tic-Tac-Toe

## *Project Description*

This application allows the user to play the game tic-tac-toe against the computer. The player will always start and
play as "X", while the computer plays "O". The user will be someone who likes to play tic-tac-toe. This project
interests me because tic-tac-toe is an interesting game and I want to take the skills I have learnt and apply it into
this project, furthering my skills and knowledge as well.

## *User Stories*
As a user, I want to be able to...

- place an "X" at a specific position on the board
- have the computer make a move against me
- look at the board with the Xs and Os on them
- quit the game
- restart the game
- know if I won
- know if the computer won
- know if there was a tie
- keep score of how many wins I've had
- keep track of how many games I've played
