# Tic-Tac-Toe

## *Project Description*

This application allows the user to play the game tic-tac-toe against the computer. The player will always start and
play as "X", while the computer plays "O". The user will be someone who likes to play tic-tac-toe. This project
interests me because tic-tac-toe is an interesting game and I want to take the skills I have learnt and apply it into
this project, furthering my skills and knowledge as well.
